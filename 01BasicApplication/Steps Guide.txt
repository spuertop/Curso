Create a folder for your project and install Electron there:
    mkdir my-electron-app && cd my-electron-app
    npm init -y
    npm i --save-dev electron

Create the main script file
    An Electron application can have only one Main process.

Create a web page
    This is the web page you want to display once the application is initialized. 
    Each window can optionally be granted with full access to Node.js API through the nodeIntegration preference.

Modify your package.json file
    the main entry point (as any other Node.js application). 
    NOTE: If the main field is omitted, Electron will attempt to load an index.js file from the directory containing package.json.
    NOTE: The author and description fields are required for packaging, otherwise error will occur when running npm run make.

Run your application
    npm start

Package and distribute the application
    using Electron Forge.
    Import Electron Forge to your app folder:
    npx @electron-forge/cli import

Create a distributable:
    npm run make
    > my-gsod-electron-app@1.0.0 make /my-electron-app
    > electron-forge make
